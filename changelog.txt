History of changes
------------------

1.2.0 [xx.10.2016]
  - Add move command to move packages between repositories.
  - Remove log files before creating them (needed for recovering after some
    failures).
  - Print elapsed time after each succeded step and overall.
  - Support stat timestamps w/o fractional part (new coreutils).
  - Support per-package ARCH specification in -env.sh (useful for e.g.
    binary-only RPMs that provide only one architecture, like libc).
  - Run rpmbuild only once for noarch-only SPEC files (this also fixes a
    regression when building such files with previous rpmbuild-bot versions).
  - Automatically commit SPEC files to SVN on upload to ensure integrity
    and consistency between published RPMs and their SPECs.
  - Add support for automatic generation of legacy runtime sub-packages.

1.1.0 [15.04.2016]

  - Disallow different .spec and main package names.
    This is to enforce consistency and avoid possible naming conflicts
    as we use the main package name for many things (like log file names)
    and it must be unique.
  - Save timestamps of generated files in list.
    This is used to check if the actual files match the ones that
    were generated by rpmbuild-bot when performing uploading or
    cleanup.
  - Add clean and remove commands.
    These are emergency commands used to cancel the successful build
    that was not yet uploaded (clean) and that was already uploaded
    (remove).
  - Add support for clean=test command.
    This cleans up the results of the "test" command instead
    of "build".
  - Copy auxiliary source files for .spec to SOURCES.
    Auxiliary source files found in a directory named SPEC located
    in the same directory where the SPEC.spec fie resides, will be
    automatically copied to the SOURCES directory of the rpmbuild
    tree (for further use in .spec via SourceN:).
  - Fix another bad variable name error (in test/clean commands).
  - Fix "empty macro body" warning.

1.0.1 [01.04.2016]

  - Fix bad variable name error.
  - Understand .CMD extension in REXX wrapper.

1.0.0 [01.04.2016]
